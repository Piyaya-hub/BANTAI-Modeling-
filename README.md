# BANTAI Modeling

BANTAI is an academic intelligent-agent project for street-issue detection and hotspot prioritization. Its broader proposal includes roadside garbage, potholes, road-surface damage, incident management, and frequency-based hotspot prioritization.

This repository's initial development scope is **trash detection on still images only**. The approved starting model is **GroundingDINO-T (Swin-T / Tiny configuration)**, evaluated through pretrained text-guided inference. Hugging Face Transformers is the selected inference library. Phase 2A has recorded the exact checkpoint/processor revision, settings, installed dependencies and basic Windows runtime readiness. Prompts, thresholds, detector processing rules and actual model execution remain unvalidated; publication of the plan does not establish their acceptance or readiness. Training, alternative models, and integration require later decisions based on evaluation evidence.

This repository is dedicated exclusively to AI modelling and computer vision: model evaluation/selection, preprocessing, detection, necessary postprocessing, accuracy/performance evaluation, approved optimization or potential fine-tuning, and reusable detection outputs for future integration. Frontend, backend application modules, central databases, incident management, reporting, and hotspot ranking are outside its implementation responsibility.

The three required output categories are **Garbage Pile**, **Individual Litter**, and **Group of Individual Litter**. Images may contain multiple independent regions and mixed categories. These are intended project outputs, not guaranteed pretrained classes. Direct prompting must be evaluated before considering spatial grouping; DBSCAN and other grouping methods are conditional alternatives requiring evidence and explicit authorization. See [scope](docs/SCOPE.md) for definitions and counting requirements.

Execution is intended for the owner’s Windows computer, preferring GPU with CPU fallback. Owner-supplied Command Prompt output now reports Windows 10 build 19045.6466, a GTX 1660 Ti with 6144 MiB VRAM, driver 472.19, and about 5235–5236 MiB free at the time of the query. This replaces the earlier RTX 2080 Super assumption. Git works. After the initial Store-alias/launcher issue, supplied output confirms Python 3.11.9 x64 installation, a successful local clone and `.venv` reporting Python 3.11.9. Supplied checks now show CPU/CUDA tensor results of 2.0, CUDA available, capability (7,5), matching direct library imports and no broken requirements. Native TkAgg rendering/normal return, checkpoint/processor metadata, official driver-reference comparison and exact dependency/source capture are also confirmed. Phase 2A technical preparation checks are complete; model-memory fit, detector execution and accuracy remain untested; see the [preflight record](docs/PHASE_2A_READINESS.md). Checkpoint metadata reports Apache-2.0, non-gated access and safetensors at immutable revision `a2bb814dd30d776dcf7e30523b00659f4f141c71`; future model and processor loading must use that same revision.

## Current state

Phase 0/Phase 1 planning and Phase 2A preparation are published (2A merged through PR #5). Codex has implemented **Phase 2B — Input and Output Foundation** for review: configuration, image preparation, result-contract utilities and strict atomic JSON persistence. The owner explicitly superseded the prior 2A-only stop boundary. No model loading, inference or viewer is implemented. Software fixtures are not model evidence; no detection quality or model-memory result exists.

The owner supplies unannotated team photographs, manually downloaded/extracted from Google Drive into a configurable project folder (proposed `data/input/`). The planned detection activity is functional checking and visual inspection, with no required annotation work, benchmark splits, precision/recall/mAP, or numeric accuracy targets.

The planned outputs are an in-memory display of original photographs with predicted boxes, category labels, and individual model-score percentages; readable summaries; per-image JSON; and run/environment metadata. Preserve originals and do not automatically save annotated copies. Model-score percentages are not accuracy, calibrated correctness probabilities, or image-area coverage. Inference and display outcomes are recorded separately under the [proposed output contract](docs/PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#7-proposed-json-contract). No model has been implemented or evaluated by this documentation work.

- [Phases and acceptance criteria](docs/PHASES.md)

## Preparation-only usage

Use the existing verified Windows `.venv`; no reinstall is needed:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\detect_images.py --help
.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\detect_images.py --input data/input --results results
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

`--config`, `--input` and `--results` accept absolute paths or paths relative to the repository root, regardless of shell working directory. Configuration is [config/detection.json](config/detection.json). Missing/empty inputs return 2; image read/decode errors return 1 after continuing the batch; unsupported-only input returns 2 with skips recorded; completed preparation returns 0. Configuration/persistence failures return 2. Generated output is JSON only under an ignored run directory. `prepared` means decoded/oriented/RGB-converted in memory, with inference explicitly unrun. No predictions are generated. Default display intent is enabled, but preparation records always say `not_attempted`.

Reusable helpers live in [scripts/](scripts/): `configuration.py`, `inputs.py`, `results.py` and `persistence.py`. Section 7 functional-result construction requires explicit inference completion/provenance; synthetic predictions appear only in [tests/test_foundation.py](tests/test_foundation.py). Mapping, duplicate selection and overlap computation are deferred.

## Dependency reproduction reference

[requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains direct supporting pins; [requirements-cuda.txt](requirements-cuda.txt) selects the original cu118 source for torch/torchvision. [requirements-windows.lock.txt](requirements-windows.lock.txt) transcribes all 36 observed packages, including bootstrap tools, with the cu118 supplementary index. It is a version snapshot without artifact hashes. No fresh installation was tested in 2B. For a future clean Windows Python 3.11 x64 environment only, the complete snapshot can be applied with `python -m pip install -r requirements-windows.lock.txt`; the original two-source route uses `requirements-cuda.txt` followed by `requirements.txt`. Revalidate affected readiness on a rebuilt environment. Preserve the existing target environment.

## Next step

Review [2B checks and limitations](docs/PHASE_2B_CHECKS.md) and [handoff](docs/HANDOFF.md). Phase 2C/model loading/inference/viewer implementation remains outside this task; no merge is authorized. The 2A records remain supplied Windows preparation evidence, while 2B checks are cloud-executed software fixtures.
